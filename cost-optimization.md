When designing your AWS network, optimizing cost is essential without compromising performance or security.

## âœ… Best Practices

âœ” **Use one NAT Gateway per region** unless you need redundancy.  
âœ” **Use static Elastic IPs** only where required.  
âœ” **Delete unused resources** like unused instances, EIPs, and load balancers.  
âœ” **Use VPC Endpoints** for S3 or DynamoDB to avoid NAT Gateway charges.  
âœ” **Enable billing alerts** and monitor usage.  
âœ” **Select appropriate instance types** based on workload.

3. Clean up unused **Elastic IPs** â†’ they incur charges.  
4. Monitor **data transfer** â†’ reduce unnecessary traffic.
