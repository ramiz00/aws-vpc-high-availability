# AWS VPC High Availability Setup

This repository contains a step-by-step guide to setting up a secure and highly available AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture using public and private subnets, NAT Gateway, Bastion Host, Application Load Balancer (ALB), and VPC Peering. The guide includes diagrams, screenshots, and cost optimization tips to help cloud engineers and DevOps enthusiasts practice real-world AWS networking.

## ðŸ›  Setup Overview

1. Create VPC with CIDR block `172.20.0.0/16`  
2. Launch public and private subnets across availability zones  
3. Configure route tables for IGW and NAT Gateway  
4. Set up Bastion Host with restricted SSH access  
5. Install and deploy a sample website in a private EC2 instance  
6. Create Application Load Balancer to expose the website securely  
7. Set up VPC Peering across regions and update routes  
8. Apply best practices for cost optimization
