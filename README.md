# AWS VPC High Availability Setup

This repository contains a step-by-step guide to setting up a secure and highly available AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) architecture using public and private subnets, NAT Gateway, Bastion Host, Application Load Balancer (ALB), and VPC Peering. The guide includes diagrams, screenshots, and cost optimization tips to help cloud engineers and DevOps enthusiasts practice real-world AWS networking.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

âœ” Create VPC with 2 public and 2 private subnets across multiple availability zones  
âœ” Configure Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway for routing  
âœ” Secure access to private instances using Bastion Host  
âœ” Deploy a website inside a private subnet using ALB  
âœ” Set up VPC Peering between different regions  
âœ” Cost optimization tips for NAT Gateway, Elastic IPs, and tenancy options  
âœ” Diagrams and commands for easy learning

## ðŸ›  Setup Overview

1. Create VPC with CIDR block `172.20.0.0/16`  
2. Launch public and private subnets across availability zones  
3. Configure route tables for IGW and NAT Gateway  
4. Set up Bastion Host with restricted SSH access  
5. Install and deploy a sample website in a private EC2 instance  
6. Create Application Load Balancer to expose the website securely  
7. Set up VPC Peering across regions and update routes  
8. Apply best practices for cost optimization

## âœ… Recommended reading order (follow this guide)

Follow these files in order for a smooth handsâ€‘on lab:

1. vpc-setup.md â€” Build the VPC, create subnets, IGW, route tables, and NAT Gateway.  
2. bastion-host.md â€” Configure the bastion (jump) host and learn the SSH workflow.  
3. website-deployment.md â€” Deploy the web server in private subnets, create ALB and target group, and configure security groups.  
4. vpc-peering.md â€” Set up VPC peering and update route tables for crossâ€‘VPC connectivity.  
5. cost-optimization.md â€” Review cost-saving options and cleanup steps.  
6. images/ â€” Open the diagrams referenced in each guide while reading.

Tip: Read vpc-setup.md fully before launching resources; use bastion-host.md during website deployment.
